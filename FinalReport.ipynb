    "Imagine that a vendor needs to start a business: a restaurant/cafe in the state of California. The first problem would be the selection of a location to establish a physical facility. The place should be selected considering <em>minimizing the costs</em> and <em>maximizing the generation of income</em>. These depend on several other factors. The most important information to consider is the number of restaurants/cafes that are already available in the neighborhood. Other than this basic factor, information such as the population of the neighborhood, public places/tourist attractions in the neighborhood also plays a major role in the success of such an establishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though an entrepreneur can do a basic identification of an opportunity by simply looking at basic factors, to see the big picture including minor details, a thorough analysis is essential. A clear idea about the competitors and the target groups in a certain neighborhood can be generated using data scientific analysis: clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using data science tools, a powerful insight can be generated and the generated insights can be presented in an easy to understand format, with the help of visualization tools. A system developed for this task can be altered according to the need of a client with minimal changes in the code which makes the system very useful to a client universally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target audience of this system includes, entrepreneurs who are planning to start a new business in town, business owners who are planning to move their already established business in to a more profitable place and restaurent\\cafe chains who are trying to create branches and expand their customer base in new areas."

The most important type of data would be the data on competitors in the neighborhood. The existing cafes/restaurants/food courts will be taken into consideration. These data can be obtained using the foursquare API using the location data. Data on the population of particular cities will also acquired using the government population data from \"https://worldpopulationreview.com/\". Finally, the other geographical factors such as public places/tourist attractions would be added to the dataset using the foursquare API.\n",

Using the data from the sources mentioned above, information will be extracted about the existing restaurents, public areas and population in the area. This will define a characteristic quality of the city which will be used to group it with cities with similar qualties. By anlyzing the groups, a conclusion will be obtained.\n",

Therefore we can leave out the cluster 0 without any issue. Similarly, cluster 3 also can be ignored based on boservation. All the other clusters seem to be almost the same in this persepective. Therefore, we have to focus on the other type of venues after that.<br>\n",
    "When we observe the other clusters, we can see that cluster 2 has a most significant venue as park, cluster 1 as resort, 4 dog run, 5 trail, 6 well and 7 playground. From this observation we can eliminate cluster 1, 5,4, and 6 since they are not places with a lot of people.\n",

    "As the conclusion, we can say that Machine Learning with data science can be used to solve business problems in a wide range. This project depicts just a very basic analysis considering the establishment of a business place. The beginning. This was done using just several free datasets and a free packege of foursquare API. Even with the basics we could develop a system that can analyze data and give a significan outcome. With the eourmous amount of data that is accessible on the internet, datascience could be the main tool in decision making in the future."
